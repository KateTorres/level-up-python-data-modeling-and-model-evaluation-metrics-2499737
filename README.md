This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.

 

Each installment of the Level Up series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get a codespace up and running.


 
In this course, instructor Seth Berry presents 20 Python challenges, starting with a test of basic skills and moving on to more complex tests of your knowledge. Each video is self-contained, so you can pick and choose which challenges you want to try. Explore these practical exercises to work on your coding skills!
